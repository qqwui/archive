## About the Archive
I've made a lot of websites, mainly in my middle school years. ~~all of which are pretty bad~~ I figured I've made enough of them that I could create one big website to host them for all prosperity. This used to be a proper jekyll website with it's own theme, but it went unmaintained for so long that the gemfile broke. Now it's just the default github pages thing.

The website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and the code is available on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/qqwui/qqwui.github.io).
